The there are two endpoints on this Martian Robots service

GET /
Returns some basic instructions for the engineers controlling the robots :)
 
POST /basestation
PAYLOAD:
{
     area: { top: 3, right: 5 },
     robots: [
          {
              position: { x: 1, y: 1, orientation: 'N' },
              instructions: ['F', 'R', ...]
          },
          ...
      ]
 }

RESPONSE: 
  ['1 1 E',...]

You can use Postman or curl to send your commands to the service.

An example command payload looks like this:

POST /basestation
{
     "area": { "top": 3, "right": 5 },
     "robots": [
          {
              "position": { "x": 1, "y": 1, "orientation": "N" },
              "instructions": ["F", "R"]
          }
      ]
 }

RESPONSE:
  ['1 2 E']

Responses is a array list containing the positions of all the robots after executing the provided commands.

The application assumes bottom is 0 and left is 0.


------------------ **** TODO's **** ------------------


Application is not complete as there are a couple of features that need implementation.

1. Proper validation and better error handling sending meaningfull status codes.
    a. As this is a service and could be consummed by other clients so the instruction set needs proper validation
    b. Errors should be handled properly to prevent service crashing and burning
    c. Obviously more security consideration needs to be put in

2. Proper code refactoring. What's here can be better, naming conventions can provide more insight as to what's going on

3. LOST robots. This, as a critical part of this challenge, is yet to be properly implemented. One idea would
    be for any robot that falls off the grid to emit an event, transmitting it's last know location before it falls off.
    This last good location would be stored by the application and made available when processing other robot instructions, to keep
    them also falling off grid. An application wide variable, session, enviroment variable, a Database or even a Redis server can be used to keep track of this information

4. Information could be transmitted in other formats than JSON for more usability across various clients.
